wher is pagination


sir in this page didnt add pagination thought of making scrollable


In every page we need a pagination when scrolling down it should get the next data
ok sir i only did in home page

ok

in javascript i found the locahost:8000 static url in all




















that was wrong you should define on place and use in all ove r application

Notification icon is not upladting after accept or cancel request . its uplating only the page refresh


Large html shoul not append like $().append("html content") we can append only small content. but when it comes to many to have a desing and template. we have to use the javascript template or create a junction and define in it and call do not make like this .


If we append large content browser will stuck and hang wen serving multiple datas


when commenting in post comment page should not refresh . comment should act like when liking the post by ajax call. and also make the comment order like recent comment should top first



when calling the invalid url . it should redirect to 404r page. it should not show the laravel debug stuff

In edit user / profile. image should be optional . 


we need a edit post option which uploaded by user and also edit comment


we need a pagination in listing finf friends also limit 10 per pagedon



note  down this task and make a list and send to me 
sure sir and one doubt

yes
in edit post will it should go to next page?sryanother page


In edit options all comment and post . the edit option should only show to the corresponding owner


And ther is no more option to change video in edit post.

Whern clicking edit icon . it should show a popopup with title and description they acan edit by poup and submit it. the data should change without page refreshing


page should not refresh .ok sir 


Any other doubts
no sir 

Ok make a list and send to me .
yes sir


after sending work on any f task and try to complete atleast one and leave  at after 7.30 
ok sir
Ok bye
